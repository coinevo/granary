Granary provides a comprehensive set of tools that you can use to develop [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) and [dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) on the [Tezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) platform. 

You can start by **developing** your contracts **in a local sandbox** where you have full control over the running blockchain, with block explorers and other supportive tools pre-configured & ready to use. Selection of different smart contract languages is supported, together with integration & deployments for production / live testing to zeronet, alphanet or mainnet. 

> ⚠️ Granary is currently in the `pre-alpha` phase, please use with caution!
