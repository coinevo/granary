Docs for Granary are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), which means that the content is located at `docs/` and the actual website is located at `website/`.

## Running the docs website locally

To run the docs website locally, you can run the following commands from the [contributor's shell](contributors-development-environment.md):

```shell
cd website && npm run start
```

If successfull - the docs website will be available at [**http://localhost:3000/granary/**](http://localhost:3000/granary/).
